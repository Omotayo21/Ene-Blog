            Hi there! My name is Eneawan but you can call me Ene. I'm an
            undergraduate studying economics as well as a sustainability
            advocate and creative living in Lagos, Nigeria.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The idea to start this blog was borne out of my love for talking
            (which I'm not ashamed to admit) but also, as the name implies,
            Sustainably Aware is a platform dedicated to spreading awareness
            about sustainable practices, environmental issues, possible
            solutions to those issues and every other green-related topic under
            the sun.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I'm neither an expert nor am I formally qualified , I'm just very
            passionate about protecting our planet and I truly believe raising
            awareness is one of the most important ways to drive meaningful
            change in the environmental space. Asides the interesting reads, the 
           <a href="/eco-crafts" className="text-blue-500 underline">  eco crafts</a> page of the website is where
            weâ€™ll get our hands dirty and learn how to upcycle our old/
            discarded items into something new and cute.
          </p>
          <p>
Thank you for coming on this journey with me as we become sustainably aware together &lt;3
